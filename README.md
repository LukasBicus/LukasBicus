## Hi there 👋

So you're curious about me...

I'm currently working with the Revoltapp company on the [entradio](https://www.entradio.cz/) project, with plans to wrap up in September 2024. But, as they say, the future is written in the stars. 🌟

If you're here to peruse my code, here's what I've been up to:
- I've contributed to the ✨ [bysquare open-source project](https://github.com/xseman/bysquare) ✨, which has been an enriching experience.
- For a mix of fun, learning, and mental gymnastics 🧠, I tackle challenges from [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015) in [this repository](https://github.com/LukasBicus/algorithms). Oh, and I've been experimenting with [Deno](https://deno.land/) there – it's pretty cool, to say the least!
- Check out some of my React projects in the [frontend-demo](https://github.com/LukasBicus/frontend-demo) repo. It's a snapshot of my coding journey from a year ago, crafted for an interview.

Now, you might wonder, what's next for me? That's a question I'm pondering too. I'm currently on the lookout for intriguing technologies to explore. Once I've quenched my curiosity, the job hunt begins. 🕵️‍♂️

Got any suggestions or know of opportunities that might suit me? Feel free to share your thoughts! If you think my CV would be a good fit for your company, I'd love to hear about that too.

Happy coding, and let's connect! 💻
